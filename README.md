# Kuxynator's Slim-Inserters

EXPERIMENTAL VERSION

Some things may still change in the near future and some things may become incompatible or disappear.

I activily use this mod in a vanilla+ game and will fix all issues that should occur in the process.

---

A new approach to inserters: they are attached directly to machines, chest and belts. This allows you to build more compact. 

Do you know Dyson Sphere Program (DSP) then they will look familiar to you.

I have wanted this functionality for years, but never had the time to implement it. So [Bleb1k](https://mods.factorio.com/user/bleb1k) did this first with his [Arrow Inserter](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/arrow-inserter)

Because Bleb1k uses an slighly differnt concept how inserters are placed and wich inserters are available, I decided to create my own version with a different approach. If you like his concept of toggling long/stack types in place, then keep playing with Arrow Inserter. I keep contributing to his mod to make it more polished and feature complete.

I start with the slim inserter series like in the vanilla series:  
- Basic Slim Inserter (Inserter)
- Long Slim Inserter (Long Handed Inserter)
- Fast Slim Inserter (Fast Inserter)
- Filter Slim Inserter (Filter Inserter)
- Stack Slim Inserter (Stack Inserter)
- Stack Filter Slim Inserter (Stack Filter Inserter)

I will extend this series over time with more inserter types if needed for compatibility.

With support of (Bob's Adjustable Inserters)[https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobinserters] you will get all variants of Long Inserters for any Filter-/Stack Inserters. Version greater then 1.1.7 is required!

A second series of inserters will give you the ability to use 2 lanes of the belt simultanously: The **Double Slim Inserter series**

## Double Slim Inserter

- Basic Double Slim Inserter
- Long Double Slim Inserter
- Fast Double Slim Inserter
- Filter Double Slim Inserter
- Stack Double Slim Inserter
- Stack Filter Double Slim Inserter

The "*Double Inserter*" is a new concept from me that allows you to use 2 inserters of the same type on one tile. They will work together to unload/load from/to both sides of a belt at the same time. With the Filter Double Inserter you can place different items on each lane of a belt.

## Dual/Multi Inserter

The "*Dual/Multi Inserter*" is a new concept from me that allows you to place 2 or more inserters of any type on one tile.
